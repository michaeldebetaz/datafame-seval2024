    "text": "<p><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"0.0\">0:00</span> Among the many, many philosophers we could mention, Jan Ersch immediately comes to Socrates. Because he is obviously very well known. But why is he so well known? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"15.0\">0:15</span> I think that one of the reasons why he has this extraordinary glory, almost to represent philosophy as such, is that he died of it. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"32.0\">0:32</span> You could say that Socrates died of philosophy. Philosophy killed him. He was condemned to death even though everyone recognised the high degree of his virtue and his philosophical lucidity. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"53.0\">0:53</span> Which is something else again than virtue. And I think it was the contrast between his fate and his presence that was decisive in this. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"70.0\">1:10</span> When you read Plato, when you read Plato, when you read the speeches, there is something so irrefutable, so present, about Socrates' presence. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"87.0\">1:27</span> And I insist on this present now. Because 'now present' are the very words of freedom. So let's not forget that we're in Greece. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"101.0\">1:41</span> We are in the 5th century BC. And there is something very special about this Socrates. He walked around Athens accompanied by his disciples and, unlike many other philosophers, he never wrote. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"117.0\">1:57</span> Yes, it's true. It's true, it's true. But how does it all work? He didn't write, that's how. And why didn't he write? He didn't write because for him there was something fixed about the written word that contradicted the essence of what he called philosophy. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"139.0\">2:19</span> I think you're right to emphasise the oral and present character of Socrates. Because, as I said, freedom is at the heart of the whole philosophical affair. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"157.0\">2:37</span> And if freedom is at the centre of the whole affair, it's because it's in the present. Freedom is in the present. It is not before, it is not after, it is not earlier, it is not later, it is now. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"174.0\">2:54</span> You're free now or you'll never be free, or you never were. Many people have suffered from this and it has been analysed a lot in modern times, this impossibility of acting, of being in the present. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"194.0\">3:14</span> Well, I think Socrates is the most present of all philosophers. He was the one most deeply attached to the literalness of the present moment, which is not the symbol but the very presence of human freedom on earth. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"217.0\">3:37</span> You can't be free yesterday, you can't be free tomorrow, you can only be free now. There are plenty of people who are ready to do phenomenal things tomorrow, in the afternoon, yesterday. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"237.0\">3:57</span> But if Socrates is now, it's this time. And there's something about that that has etched itself into people's minds. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"249.0\">4:09</span> So the figure of Socrates is the philosopher Laet, as opposed to the very handsome Plato. He is the philosopher who does not always write in relation to others, and in particular to his disciple Plato, who records Socrates' death in the Fedo. But Socrates is also the art of giving birth to the thought of others, the famous maillotique. Can you tell us a little about this? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"272.0\">4:32</span> But yes, I think it's quite easy. Once you understand what freedom is. Maillotics is childbirth. Giving birth. The birth of what? Of a free act. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"288.0\">4:48</span> Of human existence at its most active, most decreed from within, from the intimacy of being. And as a result, this is what Socrates cared about most of all. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"306.0\">5:06</span> How did he go about giving birth to the freedom of others? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"309.0\">5:09</span> To give birth to the other's freedom, he questioned him and didn't give him the answer. So he asked them questions and forced them to find their own answers. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"324.0\">5:24</span> If not now, then next time. But he would find the moment when he would put him in front of freedom, in front of the deciphering, the discovery, the digging of freedom. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"342.0\">5:42</span> And it all fits together in Socrates. Including his life, including his death. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"348.0\">5:48</span> So, about his life, a number of famous adages have survived, including the famous \"Know thyself\". What does \"Know thyself\" actually mean? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"359.0\">5:59</span> At the moment, you might think that this is psychoanalysis. But that's not it at all. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"363.0\">6:03</span> Absolutely not psychoanalysis and absolutely not psychology either. Know yourself, it's not an objective science. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"375.0\">6:15</span> It's not a science in which we're content to look inside ourselves and enter the small, discreet cells where we now go to consult a psychoanalyst. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"390.0\">6:30</span> That's not it at all. Know thyself means grasp the point of origin of your freedom. The point from which your freedom springs. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"403.0\">6:43</span> Grasp that point and take hold of it, because it's that point that makes you obsolete. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"413.0\">6:53</span> So, at the end of this 'Know thyself', Socrates declares, paradoxically enough, I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing. What does he mean by this? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"427.0\">7:07</span> What does he mean by that? I think I'll tell you. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"432.0\">7:12</span> This means that in his eyes, when you know what it is to know what human freedom is, you know that you know nothing. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"446.0\">7:26</span> Because all we know, apart from that, is content, points of doctrine. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"454.0\">7:34</span> I know that I am this if and that, I know that I have learned this if and that, I know that I have understood this if and that. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"462.0\">7:42</span> That's not me. On the other hand, there's an essential stripping away by which we reject that. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"472.0\">7:52</span> And by stripping it back, because it's paradoxical once again, by stripping it back, we reject that in the margins and we seek the heart of freedom, which is therefore the essential. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"489.0\">8:09</span> So I'd like to come back to Socrates' death. You say that Socrates paid for his philosophy with his life. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"497.0\">8:17</span> And that's true, but what was he accused of and why? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"502.0\">8:22</span> Yes, then, of course, in Plato we again find a reflection of what happens in the states. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"512.0\">8:32</span> In the Greek states? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"515.0\">8:35</span> In the Greek states and in other, non-Greek states. I mean in states in general, when you're in a state, <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"524.0\">8:44</span> the problem that is posed to your freedom, and which you must deal with, to which you must impose your will, even at the cost of your life. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"538.0\">8:58</span> We'll see what it is in a moment. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"542.0\">9:02</span> Well, in the search for this point, we have to sacrifice a whole host of obligations - read obligation - that take the place of that necessity and give themselves up for freedom. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"560.0\">9:20</span> And I would say that this is perhaps the most topical aspect of Socrates' teaching. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"568.0\">9:28</span> Because if you open a newspaper, you'll find plenty of good men signing articles explaining how free you are today. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"580.0\">9:40</span> They all know it. Only you don't know it. And it's them who don't know it when they're in the situation. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"590.0\">9:50</span> So there is an exercise in historical presence that is the Platonic exercise par excellence. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"600.0\">10:00</span> So Socrates is condemned because he is accused of corrupting young people. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"605.0\">10:05</span> He is accused of corrupting young people because he spends his time pushing back, repressing the certainties that we try to give young people and that young people could be content with. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"621.0\">10:21</span> Basically, it's the quality of critical thinking. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"624.0\">10:24</span> It's more than that. It's critical thinking, but perhaps much deeper than you're hearing at the moment. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"632.0\">10:32</span> The critical spirit is to arrive here, it's Plato, it's to arrive at the true authenticity of one's own absolutely independent decision. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"648.0\">10:48</span> Absolutely independent. And in no way enslaved by conformism, by convenience, by consequences. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"660.0\">11:00</span> You know, these days you hear so much discussion about political options and everyone brandishes one behaviour as the free behaviour. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"675.0\">11:15</span> That's free behaviour. I'll bring it to you. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"680.0\">11:20</span> And then there are some who believe that yes, they start marching in columns and go to demonstrations or not to demonstrations, it doesn't matter. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"691.0\">11:31</span> Whereas with Socrates, the work is a constant stripping away of what Jasper later called existence. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"705.0\">11:45</span> It means being there, responding to the historical moment in which we find ourselves. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"713.0\">11:53</span> So tell us about the scene of Socrates' death. It's a gripping scene? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"719.0\">11:59</span> Yes, but I think everyone knows her, don't you? Right, then. Well, Socrates is in prison. Socrates is in prison. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"730.0\">12:10</span> And he wants to die. He wants to die. He hasn't chosen to die, but since he has the choice between dying and not having that radical freedom he was talking about, which in his eyes is the only way to legitimise political behaviour. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"756.0\">12:36</span> So he's going to face death, suffer it, and thereby give the weight that you yourselves now recognise to his death. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"766.0\">12:46</span> In other words, Socrates is condemned to death by the laws of Athens, and his disciples suggest that he flee to another small kingdom and escape the sentence. And Socrates says no. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"784.0\">13:04</span> He answers no because if he answered yes, he would be agreeing to take away the meaning of the act that was essential to him. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"795.0\">13:15</span> And then Plato reports this last sentence, which was Socrates'. A cock must be sacrificed to Aesculapius. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"805.0\">13:25</span> What does that mean? It means that contrary to what most people would think, it's not that I have a gris-eff against the gods. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"823.0\">13:43</span> But on the contrary, it's a blessing that this was given to me with my death, because that way my death has all its meaning and all its effectiveness. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"835.0\">13:55</span> Socrates is the person who most fundamentally illustrates the idea that the process of thinking really does form the soul. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"846.0\">14:06</span> You can say it like that. You can say it like this. That the thought process really does shape the soul. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"856.0\">14:16</span> But I think that's saying too little. I would say something more. The thought process is itself the construction of the human being. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"868.0\">14:28</span> There is a way of engendering the human being. Socrates' death builds the human being for eternity. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"877.0\">14:37</span> What is the relationship between living and living well in philosophy, and in Socratic philosophy in particular? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"887.0\">14:47</span> Why do you see a problem with this link? I'd say it's the very point we've been talking about. It's the very point we've been talking about. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"898.0\">14:58</span> That is, to live completely to the root, the condition of being conscious, that is, the condition of Socrates or of a man in general. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"913.0\">15:13</span> To live the condition of a conscious being is necessarily to take a stand for or against, and more often against than for, the condition of human life. That's why he had to die. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"932.0\">15:32</span> Does that mean that all philosophy necessarily includes morality? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"938.0\">15:38</span> Yes, absolutely. I'd say yes, absolutely. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"943.0\">15:43</span> That it necessarily includes a moral, not in the sense that it necessarily enunciates a moral catechism, but in the sense that because this philosophy, it takes a stand until death. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"969.0\">16:09</span> And there's no stopping it. There is no gap between the scope and the event. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"976.0\">16:16</span> You once wrote that philosophers wrote so much because they couldn't say what they wanted to say. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"983.0\">16:23</span> Exactly. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"984.0\">16:24</span> But here we have the example of someone who doesn't write, and why did the others find it so difficult to say what they had to say? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"992.0\">16:32</span> Well they tried to say, many of them, and they didn't succeed completely. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"999.0\">16:39</span> And it has remained like many human things. You know that human freedom and all human things, when we take them at face value, as Plato did in the story you told, when we take these things at face value, we rarely manage to say them to the end. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1024.0\">17:04</span> So it stayed poached. That's why philosophy has so many books in libraries. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1030.0\">17:10</span> There wouldn't be so many books in libraries if philosophy achieved what it set out to achieve. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1039.0\">17:19</span> So, among the equally curious things, in all these books you mention, there are philosophies that go in the direction of building a system, and there are others that, on the contrary, try not to deconstruct the system but to circumvent the very possibility of the system. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1060.0\">17:40</span> It's true. That is to say, the first ones you mentioned, an example would be Hegel, for example, who put himself entirely into a system. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1074.0\">17:54</span> Well, for him, the system was a kind of example, but it's also grandiose in its own way. The more systematic and grandiose the example becomes, the more far-reaching and dangerous and deceptive it can be. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1096.0\">18:16</span> But on the other side, the one who wants to arrive at the nakedness of existential human presence, of the commitment to truth for truth's sake, then that gives the other pole, the Socratic pole. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1116.0\">18:36</span> And the wonderful thing, I think, is that it's both. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1119.0\">18:39</span> So I'd like us to look at this a little more closely. On the one hand, it's staging the very failure of the system, and that's a certain category of philosophy, and then there are the systematic philosophies. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1131.0\">18:51</span> And all the others in between seem less interesting, but for us it's very interesting because it's our human condition. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1140.0\">19:00</span> So these systems attempt to systematise the world precisely, but what does it mean to systematise the world in philosophical terms? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1149.0\">19:09</span> So that means we're not content with an approximation that will eventually allow us to reach the end of the century, let's say. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1161.0\">19:21</span> We wouldn't be talking about the end of the century now because we've come from a commentary, but hey. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1166.0\">19:26</span> So we're starting, looking at how we can challenge what currently exists to prepare something new. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1178.0\">19:38</span> Or, on the contrary, we seek to consolidate as much as possible what already exists. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1186.0\">19:46</span> And so, man has to deal with his history, and never finishes dealing with his history. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1194.0\">19:54</span> I'd like to turn for a moment to the role of doubt. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1198.0\">19:58</span> It is an extremely powerful force in philosophy, even if doubt has never produced any great systems. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1204.0\">20:04</span> Doubt is essential in philosophy. You have to be able to doubt in order to do philosophy. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1211.0\">20:11</span> It's certain, absolutely. But at the same time, why do we doubt? In relation to certainty. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1221.0\">20:21</span> It is because we have a sense of certainty that we doubt. Otherwise, doubt is meaningless. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1228.0\">20:28</span> Do you think it's still tempting to put systematic thinking into practice? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1233.0\">20:33</span> Not only do I think so, but you have large countries that are organised like this. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1238.0\">20:38</span> But not in terms of philosophy? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1241.0\">20:41</span> Of course, it depends on what you call philosophy. But, for example, Russian Marxism was a great, vast Aegean system, derived from Hegel, inspired by Hegel. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1258.0\">20:58</span> Except that everything went wrong. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1260.0\">21:00</span> It's all bungled, depending on opinion, as you know. People kill each other to decide whether it's been botched or not. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1268.0\">21:08</span> And then there are all sorts of ways for a story to go wrong. It starts all over again, etc. That's the ambiguity of history. <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1278.0\">21:18</span> In your opinion, is thinking richer when it is systematic or when it actually thwarts the system? <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1285.0\">21:25</span> In my opinion, thought is at its richest when it is human, i.e. ambiguous. </p>",
